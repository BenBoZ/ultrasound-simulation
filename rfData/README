== util.cpp, util.h ==
Contain the frenelInt class and related functions used for calculating the
integral involved in pressure field calculations.

== pressureField.cpp, pressureField.h ==
The header file describes a class called array that holds all the
details about the imaging array of transducers. Parameters include
1. element geometry (width, height)
2. element spacing
3. number of elements
4. tx and rx F numbers (F<0 means all elements active)
5. sound speed
It also describes a class to hold pressure field calculation.
An important function is setFocus() that calculates the necessary
element delays (phase values).
