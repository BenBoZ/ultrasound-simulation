This program has 3 parts.  The first part creates a phantom file, which is
mostly a random collection of uniformly distributed scatterers.  Each scatterer
is a spherical scatterer that reflects sound from a simulated ultrasound transducer.

The second part is used to displace scatterers, and create a second deformed phantom.  
This is useful for simulating elastographic imaging.

The third part of the program simulates ultrasound image formation in the frequency domain.
